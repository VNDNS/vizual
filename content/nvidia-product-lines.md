# NVIDIA: Evolution of Product Lines (Simple Overview)

NVIDIA started as a PC graphics company and expanded into many related product lines as computing needs changed. Below is a plain-language overview of how its products evolved over time.

## 1990s: PC Graphics Begins
- Early chips for PCs combined 2D and early 3D graphics (NV1, RIVA 128).
- GeForce launched (1999) as the main gaming graphics card brand.

## 2000s: Two Main Lines Emerge
- GeForce for gamers and consumers.
- Quadro for professional creators (workstations for CAD, 3D, video).
- SLI multi-GPU and steady generational upgrades.

## Late 2000s–2010s: GPUs for General Computing
- CUDA software lets developers use GPUs for math and science, not just graphics.
- Tesla accelerators appear for servers and supercomputers.
- Tegra chips target mobile devices and small systems; Jetson follows for edge AI and robotics.

## Mid–Late 2010s: Platforms, Not Just Chips
- Datacenter focus grows: DGX/HGX systems bundle GPUs for AI and HPC.
- Deep learning stacks mature: cuDNN, TensorRT, and broad CUDA libraries.
- Automotive line (DRIVE) provides computers and software for assisted and self-driving features.

## 2018–2020: Real‑Time Ray Tracing and AI Everywhere
- Turing GPUs add ray tracing and AI features (RTX) to GeForce and professional lines.
- Ampere generation scales from PCs (GeForce RTX 30) to datacenters (A100).

## 2021–2024: AI Datacenter Acceleration Becomes Core
- Hopper (H100) accelerates AI training and inference at large scale.
- Networking becomes a pillar: Mellanox (InfiniBand/Ethernet), NVLink, and BlueField DPUs.
- Omniverse grows for simulation and digital twins.

## 2024–2025: Next-Gen AI Systems
- Blackwell architecture is introduced (e.g., B200, GB200 systems) for faster AI workloads.
- Continued growth of full platforms: GPUs + networking + systems + software.

## Today’s Main Product Lines (at a glance)
- GeForce: consumer gaming and creator GPUs for PCs.
- RTX/Professional (formerly Quadro): pro visualization and content creation.
- Datacenter GPUs: A100/H100/Blackwell-class accelerators for AI and HPC.
- Systems & Platforms: DGX/HGX servers; NVIDIA AI Enterprise software.
- Networking: InfiniBand/Ethernet switches/adapters, NVLink, BlueField DPUs.
- Edge & Robotics: Jetson modules for embedded AI.
- Automotive: DRIVE computers and software for vehicles.
- Software Stack: CUDA and libraries that make all the hardware useful.

## Simple Takeaway
NVIDIA moved from selling single PC graphics chips to building full AI and computing platforms. GeForce and pro graphics remain, but the company’s center of gravity is now datacenter AI: powerful GPUs, fast networks, integrated systems, and the software that ties it all together.
