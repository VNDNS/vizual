# Audio Technology Tech Tree (in simple terms)

Audio tech has grown like a branching tree. Each new idea builds on older ones, opening new paths for how we capture, store, send, and play sound.

## 1) Capture (turning sound into a signal)
- Acoustic horns → focus sound without electricity
- Carbon microphones → early telephones; rough but simple
- Dynamic microphones → tough, good for loud sources
- Condenser microphones → sensitive, clear detail
- Electret and lavalier mics → small, easy to wear
- MEMS (chip mics) → tiny mics for phones and earbuds

## 2) Storage (saving sound)
- Wax cylinders → first recordings; fragile
- Shellac discs → early records
- Vinyl records → better sound, longer playtime
- Magnetic tape → easy editing, multitrack recording
- Compact cassette → portable music
- Digital PCM (CD) → clean, consistent sound
- Computer files (WAV/AIFF) → uncompressed digital
- Compressed audio (MP3/AAC/Opus) → small files for easy sharing
- Lossless (FLAC/ALAC) → smaller but full quality
- Streaming formats (HLS/DASH) → audio delivered in small chunks over the internet

## 3) Transmission (moving sound from A to B)
- Wired telephony → voice over copper
- AM radio → long range, lower quality
- FM radio → better quality, stereo
- TV audio → sound with pictures
- Satellite radio → wide coverage
- Digital radio (HD/DAB) → clearer signal, more stations
- Internet streaming → global reach, on‑demand
- Podcasts → time‑shifted radio
- Bluetooth audio → wireless personal listening

## 4) Reproduction (turning signal back into sound)
- Acoustic horns → no electronics
- Early cone speakers → basic loudspeakers
- Multi‑way speakers → separate drivers for bass/mid/treble
- Headphones → private listening
- In‑ear monitors (IEMs) → isolation, detail
- Active speakers → built‑in amps, simpler setup
- Soundbars → simpler TV audio
- Spatial/3D audio → surround and height effects

## 5) Amplification and processing
- Mechanical amplification → horns and resonators
- Vacuum tubes → warm sound, early hi‑fi
- Transistors → small, efficient, reliable
- Op‑amps and mixers → flexible routing and control
- Class‑D amps → very efficient power
- DSP (digital signal processing) → EQ, reverb, noise reduction
- Machine learning processing → echo cancel, noise removal, upmixing

## 6) Creation and editing
- Tape splicing → cut and glue
- Multitrack tape → record parts separately
- MIDI → control instruments with data
- DAWs (digital audio workstations) → record, edit, mix on computers
- Plugins (VST/AU) → flexible effects and instruments
- Cloud collaboration → work together from anywhere

## 7) Portability and devices
- Portable radios → music on the go
- Walkman → cassettes, personal listening
- Discman → CDs on the move
- MP3 players → large libraries in your pocket
- Smartphones → all‑in‑one recorder, player, streamer
- True wireless earbuds → small, convenient, noise canceling

## 8) Connections and formats
- Analog (¼", XLR, RCA) → traditional cables
- SPDIF/optical → early digital links
- USB audio → simple computer connection
- Thunderbolt/PCIe → low‑latency, pro setups
- Networked audio (Dante/AVB) → audio over Ethernet
- Bluetooth LE Audio (LC3) → efficient wireless

## Trade‑offs that shape the tree
- Quality vs size: lossless sounds best but takes more space
- Latency vs convenience: wires are fast, wireless is easy
- Durability vs fidelity: vinyl is physical; digital is resilient
- Power vs portability: big amps vs earbuds

## Where it’s heading
- Smarter processing that adapts to you and your space
- Better compression with less delay
- More lifelike spatial audio
- Easier creation tools for anyone to make and share sound
