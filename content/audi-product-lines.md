### Audi: Evolution of Product Lines (in simple terms)

- **Roots (1909–1969)**: Audi’s four rings come from Auto Union (Audi, DKW, Horch, Wanderer). Before and after World War II, the group covered everything from small, simple cars (DKW) to luxury models (Horch). After the war, the lineup narrowed to practical small cars, then the Audi name was revived under Volkswagen in the 1960s.

- **Sedan foundations (1970s–1980s)**: Audi built its reputation with clean, modern sedans. The key lines were the compact Audi 80 and the larger Audi 100. A signature idea arrived in 1980: Quattro all‑wheel drive. It spread from rally racing into road cars and became a core feature across the lineup.

- **A‑series naming (1990s)**: Audi reorganized its sedans and wagons into the A‑family:
  - A3 (compact hatch), A4 (compact sedan/wagon), A6 (mid‑size), A8 (flagship luxury).
  - Sport versions appeared as S (quick) and RS (very quick).
  - Lightweight aluminum construction debuted on the A8, shaping how Audi built premium models.

- **Icons and SUVs (2000s)**: The lineup expanded beyond sedans.
  - TT sports car made the brand feel playful and design‑led.
  - R8 supercar became the halo product.
  - Q7, then Q5 and Q3, created a full SUV family. Practical Allroad wagons added light off‑road ability.

- **Tech and breadth (2010s)**: Shared platforms (MQB/MLB) let Audi offer many sizes with similar underpinnings. Digital cabins (Virtual Cockpit) and driver assists spread across A, S, and RS models. Plug‑in hybrids ("TFSI e") added electric range to familiar shapes.

- **Electrification focus (late 2010s–present)**:
  - The first modern EVs arrived as e‑tron models (e‑tron SUV, later Q8 e‑tron), followed by the e‑tron GT and Q4 e‑tron. New EVs like the Q6 e‑tron ride on next‑gen platforms.
  - Naming is simplifying: generally, odd numbers for combustion/hybrids (A3/A5/A7; Q3/Q5/Q7) and even numbers for pure EVs (A4/A6 becoming EV lines; Q4/Q6/Q8 e‑tron). The goal is to make the product map easy to read at a glance.

- **Today’s simple map**:
  - **A / S / RS**: Sedans and wagons from compact to luxury (A3 → A8), with S and RS as performance steps.
  - **Q / SQ / RS Q**: SUVs from city‑friendly to full‑size (Q2/Q3 → Q7/Q8).
  - **e‑tron family**: Pure electric sedans/coupes and SUVs (e‑tron GT, Q4/Q6/Q8 e‑tron), rapidly growing in number.
  - TT and R8 have bowed out, with performance now concentrated in RS models and electric halo cars.

- **Strategy in plain terms**: Keep a clear staircase of sizes, offer a sporty version of almost everything, make Quattro feel natural, share as many parts as possible under the skin, and shift the center of gravity from gasoline to electric without confusing customers about where each product fits.
