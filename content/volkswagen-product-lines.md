### Volkswagen: Evolution of Product Lines (in simple terms)

- **Roots and mission (1930s–1950s)**: Built around the idea of a “people’s car,” Volkswagen started with simple, durable vehicles. The Beetle became the global icon—affordable, easy to fix, and produced for decades.

- **Growing the family (1950s–1970s)**: The Type 2 (Microbus/Transporter) added a practical van line for families and work. Coupes like the Karmann Ghia showed a design‑led side. By the 1970s, VW pivoted from rear‑engine Beetle roots to modern front‑engine, front‑wheel‑drive cars.

- **Modern core forms (1970s–1980s)**: A clear staircase of sizes arrived:
  - Polo (small), Golf (compact), Passat (mid‑size), with Scirocco/Jetta branching off the Golf.
  - GTI created the hot‑hatch template; “R” would later become the halo performance step.
  - Platform sharing began to knit the lineup together efficiently.

- **Global breadth and niches (1990s–2000s)**: The lineup widened to fit more lifestyles and regions.
  - New Beetle revived nostalgia; Sharan and other MPVs served families.
  - SUVs arrived: Touareg (2002) at the top, Tiguan (2007) as the mainstream compact.
  - TDI diesels, 4Motion AWD, and upscale trims pushed VW upmarket in places.

- **Platform strategy at scale (2010s)**: MQB underpinnings unified many models (from Polo to Passat), letting VW vary size and style while sharing parts. Digital cabins and driver assists spread across price points. Plug‑in hybrids (GTE) joined GTI and R as distinct “steps” of performance/efficiency.

- **Electrification shift (late 2010s–present)**: The ID. family on the MEB platform became the EV core.
  - ID.3 (compact hatch), ID.4/ID.5 (compact SUVs), ID. Buzz (van), ID.7 (mid‑size sedan/wagon).
  - The EV focus moved from one‑off electric versions (e‑Golf) to a dedicated, growing family.

- **Today’s simple map**:
  - **Small to mid cars**: Polo, Golf; regional sedans like Jetta.
  - **Mid/large**: Passat, Arteon (where offered).
  - **SUVs**: T‑Cross/T‑Roc (small), Tiguan (compact), Atlas/Teramont (large, regional), Touareg (flagship).
  - **Performance steps**: GTI (sporty), GTD/GTE (diesel hybrid performance where applicable), R (high performance).
  - **Electric ID. family**: ID.3, ID.4, ID.5, ID.7, ID. Buzz, with more to come.

- **Strategy in plain terms**: Keep a clear size ladder that’s easy to understand, tailor body styles to each region, share as much as possible under the skin (MQB/MEB), and shift the center of gravity from gasoline/diesel to electric without losing the familiar names and roles customers recognize.
