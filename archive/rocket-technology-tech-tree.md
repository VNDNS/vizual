## Rocket Technology: An Evolutionary Tech Tree

### Scope
This document maps the evolution of rocket technology as a branching tech tree, showing how core principles diversified into specialized sub-branches, which recombined into modern architectures. It emphasizes enabling dependencies, breakthrough nodes, and convergence trends toward fully and rapidly reusable systems.

### Foundations
- **Physics**: Tsiolkovsky rocket equation, conservation of momentum, specific impulse, thrust-to-weight, mass fraction, staging.
- **Early Propellants**: Black powder → smokeless powders → composite solids → liquid bipropellants.
- **Ignition and Control**: Pyrotechnic igniters, torch/TEA-TEB, spark ignition, hypergolic self-ignition; vanes, gimbaling, reaction control systems (RCS), thrust vector control.

### Propulsion Tech Tree
- **Solid Propulsion**
  - Early gunpowder rockets → military artillery → sounding rockets.
  - Composite propellants: ammonium perchlorate (APCP), aluminum fuel, polymer binders.
  - Grain geometries: end-burning, finocyl, star, segment casting; thrust shaping.
  - Strengths: simplicity, storability, high thrust; Limits: lower Isp, throttle-off, restart challenges.

- **Liquid Chemical Propulsion**
  - Propellant families:
    - Cryogenic: LOX/LH2 (high Isp), LOX/CH4 (balance of performance and reusability), LOX/RP-1 (high density, cost-effective).
    - Hypergolic: N2O4/MMH-UDMH (storability, reliable ignition; toxicity concerns).
    - Monopropellants: H2O2, hydrazine, “green” alternatives (AF-M315E, LMP-103S).
  - Feed systems:
    - Pressure-fed → simple, tank mass penalty → upper stages, small launchers.
    - Pump-fed → turbopumps, electric-pump-fed (battery-driven) as a modern branch.
  - Engine cycles (increasing thermodynamic efficiency and complexity):
    - Gas generator → staged combustion (oxidizer-rich, fuel-rich) → full-flow staged combustion.
    - Expander (open/closed) for LH2/CH4 upper stages.
    - Electric pump cycle (batteries or fuel cells) enabling small/medium-class engines.
  - Nozzle technologies:
    - Fixed bell (area ratio trade-offs), extendable nozzles, altitude-compensating (aerospike, plug), dual-bell.
  - Reusability enablers:
    - Robust turbomachinery, coking mitigation for hydrocarbons, deep-throttle capability, multiple restarts, long life hot sections, autogenous pressurization.

- **Hybrid Propulsion**
  - Solid fuel + liquid or gaseous oxidizer; throttle and shutdown capability with simpler storage.
  - Challenges: regression rates, injector coupling instabilities.

### Guidance, Navigation, and Control (GNC)
- **Sensors**: Gyroscopes (mechanical → ring laser → fiber optic), accelerometers (mechanical → MEMS), star trackers, GNSS.
- **Computing**: From analog and early digital to rad-hard microprocessors and fault-tolerant flight computers.
- **Actuation**: Engine gimbal, movable nozzles, RCS thrusters, cold-gas systems, control vanes for solids.
- **Software**: Navigation filters (Kalman variants), guidance laws (powered explicit guidance), robust control, system identification, FDIR.

### Structures and Materials
- **Airframes**: Aluminum-lithium alloys → composites (CFRP) → stainless steel resurgence for thermal margins and manufacturability.
- **Tanks**: Isogrid/orthogrid metallics, composite overwrapped pressure vessels (COPVs), integral tankage.
- **TPS (Thermal Protection)**: Ablatives, cork/SLA for solids; cork/tiles/blankets → metallic heat shields; active cooling for hot structures.
- **Mechanisms**: Separation systems (pyro bolts, frangible joints), deployment systems, fairings with acoustic/thermal design.

### Staging and System Architecture
- **Staging**: Serial staging, parallel strap-ons, hot/cold staging, crossfeed (explored), drop tanks.
- **Upper Stages**: High-Isp engines, extendable nozzles, long-coast restartability, settling thrusters.
- **Ascent Profiles**: Gravity turn optimization, max-Q management, throttle schedules, engine-out resiliency.
- **Payload Systems**: Fairings (jettison, recovery branches), rideshare dispensers, hosted payload interfaces.

### Reusability and Operations
- **Recovery Approaches**
  - Downrange splash (legacy), parachute recovery and refurbishment.
  - Propulsive vertical landing: grid fins, cold-gas RCS, landing legs, precise GNC, autonomous spaceport drone ships.
  - Winged/air-breathing stages (flyback boosters, lifting bodies, spaceplanes) with TPS reuse.
  - Fairing recovery and reuse: parafoils, ship-based capture, wet recovery with refurbishment.
- **Turnaround**
  - Rapid inspection (NDE, telemetry analytics), modular replacement, engine hot-fire acceptance, integrated health monitoring.
  - Design for maintainability: quick-disconnects, sealed actuators, robust seals, simplified plumbing, autogenous pressurization to reduce complexity.

### Manufacturing and Test
- **Production Methods**: CNC machining, filament winding, isogrid milling, stir/friction welding, additive manufacturing (AM) for injectors/combustion chambers/turbomachinery.
- **Propellant Handling**: Ground systems evolution—cryogenic densification, subcooling, rapid load/relief, boil-off management.
- **Verification**: Component-level hot-fire, powerpack tests, acceptance testing, stage static fires, hardware-in-the-loop simulation.

### In-Space Propulsion Branches
- **Chemical**: Storable biprops for orbital maneuvers and attitude control; restartable hydrolox/methalox upper stages.
- **Electric**: Hall-effect, ion thrusters, nested/rotating hall, gridded ion; high-Isp, low thrust, solar/nuclear power limited.
- **Sail/Non-Propulsive**: Solar sails, tethers; niche high-delta-v over long durations.

### Advanced/Emerging Branches
- **Nuclear Thermal Rockets (NTR)**: High Isp (2–3× LH2) with reactor heating propellant; challenges in materials, safety, testing.
- **Nuclear Electric Propulsion (NEP)**: Reactor-driven electric thrusters; mass/power balance and heat rejection are key.
- **Air-Breathing Combined-Cycle**: Rocket-based combined cycle (RBCC), scramjets, precooled engines (e.g., SABRE) for SSTO ambitions.
- **Green Propellants**: Reduced toxicity monoprops/biprops; logistics and safety drivers.
- **On-Orbit Refueling & ISRU**: Depot architectures, cryo transfer, boil-off control; lunar ISRU (LOX from regolith ice), Mars ISRU (methane via Sabatier).
- **On-Orbit Manufacturing/Assembly**: Large structures, repair, adaptive mission configs.

### Dependency Graph Highlights (Selected)
- Deep throttling → precise landing burn → first-stage propulsive reuse.
- Autogenous pressurization → simplified plumbing → lower mass/maintenance → faster turnaround.
- Full-flow staged combustion → lower component temperatures → higher reliability/life → reusability at scale.
- Electric pump-fed → small/medium launcher flexibility → rapid development cycles.
- Advanced guidance + robust avionics → engine-out capability → higher mission reliability.

### Convergence Trends
- Movement toward fully reusable two-stage-to-orbit (TSTO) with propulsive recovery of both stages.
- Preference for methalox for balance of performance, handling, coking resistance, and ISRU compatibility.
- Larger, fewer engines with engine-out margins and shared parts across fleets.
- Ground ops digitization: telemetry-driven maintenance, automated countdowns, reduced pad time.
