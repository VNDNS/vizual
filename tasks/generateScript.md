I am currently working on video for youtube, that visualizes the 
history of The Legend of Zelda games using an animated flow chart.
I want you to generate short summaries for each node in that flow chart.

1) Using the readFlowchart tool, read the flow chart.

2) For each node, generate a short summary.

3) Using the writeScript tool, save the script to a file. Also assign the node to the summary.
