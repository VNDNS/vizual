implemented in given file. Please move the state variable to the context file, and make sure
that it is correctly used inside the file where it is currently defined.

name of the state variable: zoom

file path of the state variable: ./frontend/plugins/animation/components/arrangement/Screen.tsx

context file path: ./frontend/plugins/animation/context.tsx
